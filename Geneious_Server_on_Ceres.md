Ceres  has a Geneious Server setup.  This server is also providing 20 floating licenses for Ceres users use.

Caviats:
* Integrated sites currently include:  Clay Center NE;Albany,CA; Stoneville MS; Fort Collins, CO; Beltsville MD.  
* The floating license server does not work over SSH tunnels, but the server can still be used if you have a perpetual license or a floating license server at your site.
